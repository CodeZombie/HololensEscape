# HololensEscape
A two-player cooperative game played with a Hololens headset and a Desktop PC.

## How does it work
One player starts an online game on their PC. Another player joins this online game on their Hololens headset.
The desktop player can walk and jump through the world, and the Hololens player can move the world around, pick up trees in the environment and place them around the world to create new paths for the desktop player to use to reach the goal.
